# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

This repository contains my implementation and practice of various data structures and algorithms (DSA) concepts.

## Overview

This project serves as a personal practice space for mastering fundamental DSA concepts, which are essential for problem-solving, coding interviews, and becoming a better programmer.

## Data Structures Implemented

- **Arrays**: Basic operations and manipulations
- **Queues**: Standard queue implementation
- **Circular Queues**: Implementation with cyclic buffer
- **Linked Lists**: Singly linked list implementation
- **Big O Notation**: Analysis of time and space complexity

## Directory Structure

```

├── big(O)           # Big O notation examples and analysis
└── README.md        # Project documentation
```

## Learning Goals

- Understand the fundamentals of data structures
- Analyze algorithm efficiency using Big O notation
- Implement common data structures from scratch
- Practice problem-solving using appropriate data structures
- Prepare for technical interviews

## Usage

Each file contains implementations that can be imported and used in your projects or modified for learning purposes.

```python
# Example usage of a data structure
from Queue import Queue

# Create a new queue
my_queue = Queue()

# Operations
my_queue.enqueue(10)
my_queue.enqueue(20)
front_item = my_queue.dequeue()
```
